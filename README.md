# Chinese-Checkers
# A program for playing chinese checkers, with server integration
#
# This project was done as an extension on a ISC4UE course, which was the development of a program 
# that played basic chinese checkers over a devloped in-class server. This repository is being uploaded in retrospect,
# as some people may find the chinese chckers engine code useful.
# 
# To run a local test version, execute CheckerMain.
